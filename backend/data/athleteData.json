      "bio": "In the period between his elite debut in 2010 and 2018, Canadian moguls specialist Mikael Kingsbury set a host of records in the World Cup, winning the overall title seven times in a row and scoring 49 wins and 73 podium finishes in 90 starts. He then capped it all by fulfilling his dream of winning Olympic gold at PyeongChang 2018A LOCAL SPECIALITYLearning to ski on the slopes of Quebec’s Laurentian Mountains seems to be a fool-proof formula for Olympic success. The Canadian province is home to a long line of freestyle champions, among them Jean-Luc Brassard, Olympic mogul champion at Lillehammer 1994; Alexandre Bilodeau, two-time Olympic champion at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014; and the Dufour-Lapointe sisters, Justine and Chloe, who scored a one-two at Sochi 2014.  Hailing from Deux-Montagnes, Kingsbury has proved a more than worthy addition to that list. A serial record breaker on the FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup circuit, he won moguls silver at Sochi 2014 and then went one better in the event at PyeongChang 2018. FAST LEARNERThe Quebec-born star showed his unshakeable belief in himself when he was nine, when he stuck a drawing of the Olympic rings on his bedroom ceiling and inscribed it with the words. “I’m going to win”. When he burst onto the international scene nine years later, Kingsbury had that goal very much in his sights: “[My aim is] to win gold in Sochi in 2014,” he pledged. With his maiden moguls victory in Beida Lake (CHN) on 21 December 2010, he became the youngest ever winner of a World Cup event, the prelude to a series of remarkable results that would make him world No1. ON TOP OF THE WORLDThe Canadian was 19 when he won his first moguls and overall World Cup titles in 2012. He repeated the feat the following season and in the process set a new record of 19 consecutive top-three finishes, including 13 wins, between 10 December 2011 and 23 February 2013.   “I can’t really explain my success,” he said. “I work hard at the gym and on my skis. Every time I enter a competition, my aim is to win it, and I really do enjoy what I do. I would imagine that it’s a combination of all these factors that enables me to get good results. I’m a perfectionist when I ski… and I’m able to fully focus on what I’m doing for long periods.” BILODEAU’S SUCCESSORKingsbury’s sudden emergence motivated the 2010 Olympic champion Bilodeau to push himself further, with both men taking moguls to a whole new level during the 2013/14 season. With a perfect descent and some spellbinding acrobatics, it was Bilodeau who prevailed when the two squared off in the Olympic final in Sochi, retaining his Olympic title with a total of 26.31 points. Virtually flawless in the air, Kingsbury was less precise on the moguls and scored 24.71, good enough only for silver.  Announcing his retirement afterwards, Bilodeau said: “Canadian freestyle skiing has a big future. There are a lot of youngsters coming through and I’m delighted to share the podium with one of them. When I go, Mikael’s going to win every competition he enters.”  UNTOUCHABLEBilodeau has since been proved right. Extremely fast and accurate on the moguls, Kingsbury is also an artist in the air, with his perfectly executed Cork 1080 off-axis spin invariably giving him the edge over the competition. The Canadian followed up his first Olympic medal by continuing to dominate the World Cup scene, becoming the most successful freestyle skier of all time.  He followed up his 2012 World Cup double with six more moguls and overall titles in a row. The winner of nine events in 2014, seven in 2015, another seven in 2016, ten in 2017, and seven again in 2018, he racked up an unmatched total of 49 victories and 73 top-three finishes in 90 starts in that seven-season period.  He is also the only freestyle skier in history to have completed a moguls/dual moguls double at the same event: in Deer Valley (USA) in 2015 and again in Thaiwoo (CHN) two years later. That Chinese double formed part of a record run of seven consecutive victories on the circuit between January and February 2017, which also included a win in the PyeongChang 2018 Olympic test event at Bokwang Phoenix Park. “It’s great to… progress towards the Olympic Games,” he said after his win in the Republic of Korea. “It’s wonderful to be on top of the podium and I hope I’m there again next year.”   OLYMPIC CHAMPION AT LASTA surprise bronze medallist in the moguls at the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships in Sierra Nevada (ESP) in March 2017, when he was also eliminated in the last 16 of the dual moguls, Kingsbury quickly regained his very best form, winning six consecutive World Cup races.  His confidence restored, the Canadian resumed his quest for Olympic gold at PyeongChang 2018, topping the standings in qualification, held on the same day as the Opening Ceremony. Fourth in Final 1, he placed second in Final 2, and then saved the best till last in Final 3.  In a flawless descent, Kingsbury pulled out two huge jumps – the second of them a majestic D-Spin – to score 86.63 points and finish well clear of Australia’s Matt Graham in silver and Japan’s Daichi Hara in bronze. “I’ve been dreaming of this since I was eight,” said the newly crowned Olympic champion. “I’ve achieved my dream and it’s the greatest day of my life. I’ve won lots of World Cup races in my career but to win this is something else. It’s one night every four years and I’ve proved I can do it. I’ll now be an Olympic champion for the rest of my life.”  Intent on defending his title at Beijing 2022, the all-conquering Kingsbury told Radio Canada how he stays motivated in a March 2018 interview: “I don’t necessarily think I’ve got things to prove. I’ve beaten all the records and in terms of statistics I’m the greatest of all time. I just want to prove things to myself. I feel I can carry on being the best, and when the day comes that people start saying that I’m not, I’ll want to go out there and prove them wrong.”  \r                                ",

Fourth in Final 1, he placed second in Final 2, and then saved the best till last in Final 3.  In a flawless descent, Kingsbury pulled out two huge jumps – the second of them a majestic D-Spin – to score 86.63 points and finish well clear of Australia’s Matt Graham in silver and Japan’s Daichi Hara in bronze. “I’ve been dreaming of this since I was eight,” said the newly crowned Olympic champion. “I’ve achieved my dream and it’s the greatest day of my life. I’ve won lots of World Cup races in my career but to win this is something else. It’s one night every four years and I’ve proved I can do it. I’ll now be an Olympic champion for the rest of my life.”  Intent on defending his title at Beijing 2022, the all-conquering Kingsbury told Radio Canada how he stays motivated in a March 2018 interview: “I don’t necessarily think I’ve got things to prove. I’ve beaten all the records and in terms of statistics I’m the greatest of all time. I just want to prove things to myself. I feel I can carry on being the best, and when the day comes that people start saying that I’m not, I’ll want to go out there and prove them wrong.”  \r                                ",

Four years later in PyeongChang, at the age of 27, the US skier repeated the trick thanks to a stunning third run, remaining the event’s only Olympic champion.Jump startDavid Wise grew up in a family of winter sports enthusiasts in the Nevada town of Reno, not far from California’s popular ski resorts. On skis from the age of three, he developed a love of jumping, be it on the trampoline in his back garden or on the Sierra Nevada slopes. After joining a local freestyle skiing team at the age of 11, the youngster discovered the halfpipe event, in which he began to compete at junior level.Bag of tricksExcelling at his chosen discipline, Wise was crowned US champion at the age of 15 and made his FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup debut three years later. In 2009, he became the first skier to land the double cork 1260, a trick that would become his signature move.Having captured the halfpipe titles in the 2012 World Cup and at the 2013 FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships in Voss (NOR), the American athlete also claimed a record three successive Winter X Games crowns in Aspen (USA) between 2012 and 2014.Olympic dreamIn 2011, the International Olympic Committee confirmed that ski halfpipe would be included in the freestyle programme at Sochi 2014, thereby bringing Wise’s dreams of Olympic glory one step closer. Upon arriving in Russia three years later, he could not hide his delight. “It’s crazy!” he said. “You look forward to something for so long…and it’s so far in the future and then, ‘Oh, we’re in Russia. Oh, here’s our first practice day. Oh, wow, we’re competing.’ And then all of a sudden, it’s over.”Making historyOn 18 February 2014, in difficult, snowy conditions at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, Wise dug deep to prevail in the Olympic halfpipe final, producing a resilient first run that featured two double corks, including one of his trademark 1260s, and earning a score of 92.00 that his rivals were incapable of trumping. Canada’s Mike Riddle (90.60) and France’s Kevin Rolland (88.60) took silver and bronze.Once his historic achievement had sunk in, a broad smile spread across his face. “It’s too incredible to be true…Becoming the first halfpipe gold medallist is one of the most insane things imaginable. I’m so fortunate, as the winner gets to represent the sport all over the world, and that idea really excites me.”Grand plansTurning his thoughts to his next Olympic adventure, Wise said: “I’m a huge strategist. I like to make plans. I’m excited to play the game again. Where is the sport going to go and who is going to be leading the charge? I’m looking forward to it.”Starting overWise did not enjoy the best of runs after his Sochi triumph, as he contended with a dip in form and then a string of injuries. The US rider got back to his best, however, as he prepared for PyeongChang 2018, winning a fourth X Games superpipe title in Aspen, his first victory in the event since 2014.When the time came to defend his Olympic crown, Wise had a scare when he lost a ski on both his opening runs, leaving him in ninth place. With his compatriot Alex Ferreira in the lead, the defending champion showed his coolness under pressure on his final run, landing a switch double cork 1080 and a double cork 1260 and then repeating the same two tricks to score 97.20 points and maintain his status as the only man to win Olympic ski halfpipe gold.“Today was an incredible journey,” he said after his victory. “Watching Alex land all his runs and the standard in the qualifiers inspired me. Winning or losing didn’t matter; I just wanted to do a good run. And I managed to do it right when I needed to.”Very active on social media through his YouTube channel, Wise documented his journey to his second Olympic title and the media marathon that followed as he made his triumphant return to Reno.",

      "bio": "The youngest ever Italian to win a medal at the Winter Games – aged 15 in 2006 – Arianna Fontana finally secured a gold in her fourth Games, PyeongChang 2018, in the 500m. Arianna took home three medals (bringing her total to eight) to become the most decorated female short track speed skater in Olympic history.No limitsOn 10 December 2017, Arianna Fontana, named flagbearer for Italy at the PyeongChang Games, posted a photo of herself as a child on Instagram, wearing skates, a ski suit, knee pads and a short track helmet, and wrote: \"I remember the exact moment that I decided to follow my passion. It is easy to remember, because I have thought of this moment every time I have been doubted, every time I was told that I wouldn't make it. It is in these moments that I have found the strength and the motivation to push myself and to realise that there are no limits, only in our imagination. Limits imposed by other people are not for me nor for those who remain committed to their vision.\" Born in Sondrio, in the Valtellina valley (Lombardy), Arianna began in her discipline at age four, following in the footsteps of her older brother. The talent she showed from an early age saw her join the Italian team at age 15 and promptly mount three podiums (500m, 1,500m and 3,000m) to give her second place overall at the European Championships in Krynica-Zdrój (Poland). Full speed ahead to Turin 2006!The youngest ever Italian to medal at the Winter GamesOn the ice in the Palavela arena in Turin, in front of a home audience, Arianna was eliminated in the quarter-final of the 500m and the semi-final of the 1,000m, from which she went on to place third in the B final, for sixth place overall. And on 22 February 2006, she competed in the final of the 3,000m relay with Marta Capruso, Katia Zini and Mara Zini. South Korea took gold and, with China disqualified, Canada secured silver and Italy bronze. At age 15 and 314 days, Arianna became the youngest ever Italian to win an Olympic medal at the Winter Games. As such, the young skater was named a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.Making history for Italy at Vancouver 2010Determined to do all she could to close the technical gap separating her from the best Korean and Chinese skaters, Arianna won her first world medal at the 2007 World Championships in Milan (silver in the 500m) and shone on the European stage by winning the overall title in both 2008 and 2009, as well as a total of eight European gold medals in the period to 2010. At the Vancouver Winter Games, in the majestic Pacific Coliseum, the champion from Bormio Ghiaccio ASD was eliminated in the quarter-final of the 1,000m, finished third in the semi-final of the 1,500m and then ninth overall after winning the B final. The Italian 3,000m relay team also went out in the semi-final and did not perform well in the B final. But after a brilliant performance in the 500m, Arianna battled it out in the final on 17 February, maintaining third place throughout the race to take bronze behind Canada's Marianne St-Gelais (silver) and China's Wang Meng (gold). She became the first Italian to win an Olympic medal in a women's individual short track skating event.Repeated successesIn 2011, 2012 and 2013, Arianna reaffirmed her status as the unbeatable European champion by winning the overall title in the European Championships in Heerenveen (Netherlands), Mladá Boleslav (Czech Republic) and Malmö (Sweden). She also claimed her first overall bronze at the World Cup in Sheffield (United Kingdom) – with two silver medals in the 500m and 1,000m – and her second in Shanghai (China) the following year. In addition, she finished the 2011-2012 season at the top of the World Cup overall standings for the 500m, something which the Italian had not previously achieved. She explained in January 2014: \"I aim to arrive at Sochi in peak physical and mental condition. I will attempt to make it to the finals of all distances, including the relays, and I will try for the medal each time.\" An Olympic target that she very nearly met!Three podium places at Sochi 2014In the space of five days, from 13 to 18 February 2014, Arianna did not step down from the podium in Sochi's Iceberg arena. It all started with an incredible 500m final: four laps from the finish, British skater Elise Christie took down Arianna and Park Seung-hi (South Korea) in a group crash behind Li Jianrou (China). The Chinese skater continued the race alone and took gold. The other three finalists picked themselves up and Christie crossed the line in second place, in front of Arianna. The Brit was then disqualified and the Italian awarded the silver medal, which, in her words, \"felt like gold\". Two days later, during the 1,500m final, a crash at the back of the field eliminated three of the seven skaters. Arianna maintained her position behind Shim Suk-hee (South Korea) and Zhou Yang (China) to cross the line for bronze. Finally, on 18 February, China was disqualified after the 3,000m relay, putting the Italian team (Arianna, Lucia Peretti, Martina Valcepina and Elena Viviani) – who crossed the line fourth – on the third step of the podium, which was topped by the South Korean team. But Arianna fell one event short of reaching her goal, after being given a penalty in the quarter-final of the 1,000m.A break before her fourth Winter GamesWith four Olympic medals by the age of 23, Arianna took a long break beginning in 2015. \"I was pretty tired mentally. My body was ready to race again but my mind was not. I had some doubts on whether to keep skating or not.\" During her time away from the ice, she took up boxing! When she returned to competition, qualifying for her fourth Winter Games in PyeongChang, she resumed her European dominance with new overall victories in Turin in 2017 and Dresden in 2018, one month before the Winter Games. Her European medal total reached 41 podium places and 24 titles, including seven overall wins.Gold finally, and the record too!The 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games turned into a fairy tale for the 27-year-old champion. After carrying the Italian flag in the Opening Ceremony, Arianna finally reached her goal: on 13 February, in the packed Gangneung arena, she led the 500m final from start to finish, then held out against Choi Min-jeong to cross the line a skate's length (22cm) ahead of the South Korean, who was later disqualified for obstruction. The Italian's sixth Olympic medal was gold! \"When I saw I was first, I was just yelling and started crying. I worked for four years, and the last four months were really hard for me. I was really focused on getting here in the best shape ever. I have been chasing gold and, finally, I have it,\" she said.After placing seventh, and last, in the 1,500m final won by Choi, Arianna took the silver medal with Lucia Peretti, Cecilia Maffei and Martina Valcepina in the 3,000m relay, despite being caught up in a crash. Italy were the only team to officially finish behind South Korea; the other two teams – China and Canada – were disqualified, meaning that the Dutch team, winners of the B final, took bronze. Finally, two days later, Fontana won her eighth Olympic medal after finishing third in the 1,000m final won by the Dutch skater Suzanne Schulting, with silver going to the Canadian Kim Boutin. In four Olympic Games, Arianna Fontana has won a total of one gold medal, two silver medals and five bronze medals: she is the most decorated female short track skater of all time, equalling the records of the American Apolo Anton Ohno (two gold, two silver and four bronze) and the South Korean then Russian Viktor An (six gold and two bronze). After leaving some doubt as to her possible retirement from the sport, Arianna announced at the end of May 2018 that she intends to continue competing. \"It is time to resume training, to get in shape, to make plans for the years ahead, which will take me to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,\" she said. And her objective is clear: \"With just one more medal, I can become the no.1 Olympian of all time for my sport,\" – both men and women included!",

Arianna took home three medals (bringing her total to eight) to become the most decorated female short track speed skater in Olympic history.No limitsOn 10 December 2017, Arianna Fontana, named flagbearer for Italy at the PyeongChang Games, posted a photo of herself as a child on Instagram, wearing skates, a ski suit, knee pads and a short track helmet, and wrote: \"I remember the exact moment that I decided to follow my passion. It is easy to remember, because I have thought of this moment every time I have been doubted, every time I was told that I wouldn't make it. It is in these moments that I have found the strength and the motivation to push myself and to realise that there are no limits, only in our imagination. Limits imposed by other people are not for me nor for those who remain committed to their vision.\" Born in Sondrio, in the Valtellina valley (Lombardy), Arianna began in her discipline at age four, following in the footsteps of her older brother. The talent she showed from an early age saw her join the Italian team at age 15 and promptly mount three podiums (500m, 1,500m and 3,000m) to give her second place overall at the European Championships in Krynica-Zdrój (Poland). Full speed ahead to Turin 2006!The youngest ever Italian to medal at the Winter GamesOn the ice in the Palavela arena in Turin, in front of a home audience, Arianna was eliminated in the quarter-final of the 500m and the semi-final of the 1,000m, from which she went on to place third in the B final, for sixth place overall. And on 22 February 2006, she competed in the final of the 3,000m relay with Marta Capruso, Katia Zini and Mara Zini. South Korea took gold and, with China disqualified, Canada secured silver and Italy bronze. At age 15 and 314 days, Arianna became the youngest ever Italian to win an Olympic medal at the Winter Games. As such, the young skater was named a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.Making history for Italy at Vancouver 2010Determined to do all she could to close the technical gap separating her from the best Korean and Chinese skaters, Arianna won her first world medal at the 2007 World Championships in Milan (silver in the 500m) and shone on the European stage by winning the overall title in both 2008 and 2009, as well as a total of eight European gold medals in the period to 2010. At the Vancouver Winter Games, in the majestic Pacific Coliseum, the champion from Bormio Ghiaccio ASD was eliminated in the quarter-final of the 1,000m, finished third in the semi-final of the 1,500m and then ninth overall after winning the B final.

Italy were the only team to officially finish behind South Korea; the other two teams – China and Canada – were disqualified, meaning that the Dutch team, winners of the B final, took bronze. Finally, two days later, Fontana won her eighth Olympic medal after finishing third in the 1,000m final won by the Dutch skater Suzanne Schulting, with silver going to the Canadian Kim Boutin. In four Olympic Games, Arianna Fontana has won a total of one gold medal, two silver medals and five bronze medals: she is the most decorated female short track skater of all time, equalling the records of the American Apolo Anton Ohno (two gold, two silver and four bronze) and the South Korean then Russian Viktor An (six gold and two bronze). After leaving some doubt as to her possible retirement from the sport, Arianna announced at the end of May 2018 that she intends to continue competing. \"It is time to resume training, to get in shape, to make plans for the years ahead, which will take me to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,\" she said. And her objective is clear: \"With just one more medal, I can become the no.1 Olympian of all time for my sport,\" – both men and women included!",

      "bio": "The youngest ever Italian to win a medal at the Winter Games – aged 15 in 2006 – Arianna Fontana finally secured a gold in her fourth Games, PyeongChang 2018, in the 500m. Arianna took home three medals (bringing her total to eight) to become the most decorated female short track speed skater in Olympic history.No limitsOn 10 December 2017, Arianna Fontana, named flagbearer for Italy at the PyeongChang Games, posted a photo of herself as a child on Instagram, wearing skates, a ski suit, knee pads and a short track helmet, and wrote: \"I remember the exact moment that I decided to follow my passion. It is easy to remember, because I have thought of this moment every time I have been doubted, every time I was told that I wouldn't make it. It is in these moments that I have found the strength and the motivation to push myself and to realise that there are no limits, only in our imagination. Limits imposed by other people are not for me nor for those who remain committed to their vision.\" Born in Sondrio, in the Valtellina valley (Lombardy), Arianna began in her discipline at age four, following in the footsteps of her older brother. The talent she showed from an early age saw her join the Italian team at age 15 and promptly mount three podiums (500m, 1,500m and 3,000m) to give her second place overall at the European Championships in Krynica-Zdrój (Poland). Full speed ahead to Turin 2006!The youngest ever Italian to medal at the Winter GamesOn the ice in the Palavela arena in Turin, in front of a home audience, Arianna was eliminated in the quarter-final of the 500m and the semi-final of the 1,000m, from which she went on to place third in the B final, for sixth place overall. And on 22 February 2006, she competed in the final of the 3,000m relay with Marta Capruso, Katia Zini and Mara Zini. South Korea took gold and, with China disqualified, Canada secured silver and Italy bronze. At age 15 and 314 days, Arianna became the youngest ever Italian to win an Olympic medal at the Winter Games. As such, the young skater was named a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.Making history for Italy at Vancouver 2010Determined to do all she could to close the technical gap separating her from the best Korean and Chinese skaters, Arianna won her first world medal at the 2007 World Championships in Milan (silver in the 500m) and shone on the European stage by winning the overall title in both 2008 and 2009, as well as a total of eight European gold medals in the period to 2010. At the Vancouver Winter Games, in the majestic Pacific Coliseum, the champion from Bormio Ghiaccio ASD was eliminated in the quarter-final of the 1,000m, finished third in the semi-final of the 1,500m and then ninth overall after winning the B final. The Italian 3,000m relay team also went out in the semi-final and did not perform well in the B final. But after a brilliant performance in the 500m, Arianna battled it out in the final on 17 February, maintaining third place throughout the race to take bronze behind Canada's Marianne St-Gelais (silver) and China's Wang Meng (gold). She became the first Italian to win an Olympic medal in a women's individual short track skating event.Repeated successesIn 2011, 2012 and 2013, Arianna reaffirmed her status as the unbeatable European champion by winning the overall title in the European Championships in Heerenveen (Netherlands), Mladá Boleslav (Czech Republic) and Malmö (Sweden). She also claimed her first overall bronze at the World Cup in Sheffield (United Kingdom) – with two silver medals in the 500m and 1,000m – and her second in Shanghai (China) the following year. In addition, she finished the 2011-2012 season at the top of the World Cup overall standings for the 500m, something which the Italian had not previously achieved. She explained in January 2014: \"I aim to arrive at Sochi in peak physical and mental condition. I will attempt to make it to the finals of all distances, including the relays, and I will try for the medal each time.\" An Olympic target that she very nearly met!Three podium places at Sochi 2014In the space of five days, from 13 to 18 February 2014, Arianna did not step down from the podium in Sochi's Iceberg arena. It all started with an incredible 500m final: four laps from the finish, British skater Elise Christie took down Arianna and Park Seung-hi (South Korea) in a group crash behind Li Jianrou (China). The Chinese skater continued the race alone and took gold. The other three finalists picked themselves up and Christie crossed the line in second place, in front of Arianna. The Brit was then disqualified and the Italian awarded the silver medal, which, in her words, \"felt like gold\". Two days later, during the 1,500m final, a crash at the back of the field eliminated three of the seven skaters. Arianna maintained her position behind Shim Suk-hee (South Korea) and Zhou Yang (China) to cross the line for bronze. Finally, on 18 February, China was disqualified after the 3,000m relay, putting the Italian team (Arianna, Lucia Peretti, Martina Valcepina and Elena Viviani) – who crossed the line fourth – on the third step of the podium, which was topped by the South Korean team. But Arianna fell one event short of reaching her goal, after being given a penalty in the quarter-final of the 1,000m.A break before her fourth Winter GamesWith four Olympic medals by the age of 23, Arianna took a long break beginning in 2015. \"I was pretty tired mentally. My body was ready to race again but my mind was not. I had some doubts on whether to keep skating or not.\" During her time away from the ice, she took up boxing! When she returned to competition, qualifying for her fourth Winter Games in PyeongChang, she resumed her European dominance with new overall victories in Turin in 2017 and Dresden in 2018, one month before the Winter Games. Her European medal total reached 41 podium places and 24 titles, including seven overall wins.Gold finally, and the record too!The 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games turned into a fairy tale for the 27-year-old champion. After carrying the Italian flag in the Opening Ceremony, Arianna finally reached her goal: on 13 February, in the packed Gangneung arena, she led the 500m final from start to finish, then held out against Choi Min-jeong to cross the line a skate's length (22cm) ahead of the South Korean, who was later disqualified for obstruction. The Italian's sixth Olympic medal was gold! \"When I saw I was first, I was just yelling and started crying. I worked for four years, and the last four months were really hard for me. I was really focused on getting here in the best shape ever. I have been chasing gold and, finally, I have it,\" she said.After placing seventh, and last, in the 1,500m final won by Choi, Arianna took the silver medal with Lucia Peretti, Cecilia Maffei and Martina Valcepina in the 3,000m relay, despite being caught up in a crash.
